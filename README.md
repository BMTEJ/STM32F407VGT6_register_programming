# STM32F4VGT_register_programming
MOTIVATION: 10 Mini-projects to familiarize myself with STM32CubeIDE, register based programming, and the STM32F407VGT7 (Discovery).

METHODS: The projects are done using the datasheet for STM32F407VGT7 [https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/dm00037051.pdf](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/dm00037051.pdf)
Files will include comments explaining logic and reasoning that are directly from myself, they will start with UC (user comment), assume any other comment is due to the code being a template file if ther are any.

LANGUAGE: C
