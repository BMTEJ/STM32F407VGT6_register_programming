# STM32F407VGT6_register_programming
MOTIVATION: 10 Mini-projects to familiarize myself with STM32CubeIDE, register based programming, and the STM32F407VGT6 (Discovery).

METHODS: The projects are done using the datasheet for STM32F407VGT6 [https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/dm00037051.pdf](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/dm00037051.pdf)
Files will include comments explaining logic and reasoning that are directly from myself, they will start with UC (user comment), assume any other comment is due to the code being a template file if ther are any.
All code is written into Project_name/SRC/main.c. Main.h files are included to satisfy other file's referenced that STM32CubeIDE has preapred for each board when starting a new project.

LANGUAGE: C

CREDITED PROJECT SOURCE: ControllersTech [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_LFAlOlSk&list=PLfIJKC1ud8ghc4eFhI84z_3p3Ap2MCMV-](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfIJKC1ud8ghc4eFhI84z_3p3Ap2MCMV-)

*ControllersTech used the STM32F4NUCLEO, so register names are changed appropriately to match the STM32F4 Discovery (found in the header file stm32f407xx.h.
